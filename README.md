# Smart Stats

A cute little status page for UCS server owners to make their community to know what is happening with the server

##NOT TESTED!!!

As a result of development problem with UCS after the latest commit created by @aidid, Netowking code has not been working. ***We have provided a custom UCS and it will work only with that!****

##Installation

* Open config.php from scripts folder
* Edit the IP and all other things to your server
* Save it and start your server and script

##Ideas for v4.0

After a long plan, we've decided to release version 4.0 with 

* Full automated UCS restater/Stoper/Starter in web interface (admin process)
* Online, live DATABASE editing tools (Admin process)
* Account specailly for ADMIN (only person to use admin process)
* Automatic UCS and Script updater
* CSV files editing and updating in web interface (might be introduced in 5.0)
* Automatic patcher and uploader to our global secure server
* And more....

I you are willing to make any changes please make a pull request or

Code with me in CLOUD at [cloud9](https://ide.c9.io/karansanjeev/smartstats "come on, click it")

If you have any other problem, suggestion, please make a issue for that and be as discriptive as possible but be narrow also!
